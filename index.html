			<h3>An open-source C++ library for network programming (NetB)</h3>
			<p>NetB was originally initiated as my class project for Computer Networks, 
				when I was a student at the George Washington University. It was designed 
				as a C++ library implements object-oriented interface for network programming. 
				During the past years, NetB evolved from time to time, as the result of my 
				practice-based learning of network programming. The code involves object-oriented 
				design and C++ programming, socket API, error handling, event-driven notification 
				and asynchronous I/O (reactor design pattern), I/O buffer and protocol message 
				serialization, and implementation of popular Internet protocols (Fig.1). NetB is 
				not a software framework; it is a library consists of the components useful for 
				assembling network applications.</p>
			<img src="./images/netb.png" />
			<p>NetB was the basis of my projects that involved network programming and now 
				released as an open-source software library under GPL 3.0 or later. The repository 
				of source code and documents is at https://github.com/maoxuli/netb. It currently 
				is still under development and there is no guarantee for its stability. You may 
				use it as a good example for learning socket programming or as a code base for 
				network applications. The supported platforms will include the major operating 
				systems for server, desktop PC, mobile device, and microcomputer like Raspberry PI.</p>
