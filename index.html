			<h3>An open-source C++ library for network programming (NetB)</h3>
			<p>NetB was originally initiated as my class project for Computer Networks, when I was 
				a student at the George Washington University. It has been evolving as the result 
				of my practice-based learning of network programming, which involves object-oriented 
				design and design patterns, C++ exception handling, socket API, asynchronous I/O 
				with socket de-multiplexing and event-driven notifications (reactor pattern), I/O 
				buffering, important Internet protocols and protocol message serialization. NetB is 
				not a software framework; it was designed as a C++ library consists of the components 
				useful for assembling network applications (Fig.1). </p>
			<img src="./images/fig-1.png" />
			<p>NetB has been now released as an open-source software library under GPL license. The 
				repository of source code and documents is at <a href="https://github.com/maoxuli/netb">
				https://github.com/maoxuli/netb</a>. It is still under development and there is no 
				guarantee for the stability, but you may use it as a good example or a code base for 
				network programming. NetB will supports the major operating systems for server, PC, 
				mobile device, and microcomputer (Raspberry PI). </p>

			<h3>Real-Time Remote Monitoring and Peer-to-Peer VPN</h3>
			<p>Typical remote monitoring system used in industry is based on local communication links 
				such as RS422/RS485 serial bus or RF signal channels. A local monitoring station can 
				connect a certain number of electronic sensors and cover a limited distance. Larger 
				system usually means more monitoring stations and more attendants (Fig.2). I had worked 
				in a team (as consultant and contract software engineer) to develop a remote monitoring 
				system based on public Internet, which supports a large number of unattended monitoring 
				stations with a single remote monitoring center (Fig.3).</p>
			<img src="./images/fig-2-3.png" />
			<p>Serial to Ethernet devices deployed in unattended monitoring stations receive monitoring 
				data from local communication links and multicast it to a group on local Ethernet. We 
				developed a data server based on a headless microcomputer (Raspberry PI) to filter and 
				forward requested monitoring data from local network to remote monitoring center over 
				public Internet (Fig.3-5). I was in charge of the development of software running on 
				data server, as well as the SDK used for development of software running in the 
				monitoring center. It involves socket programming for UDP protocol and  multicasting, 
				as well as a high-efficient model for packet filtering and forwarding.</p>
			<img src="./images/fig-4-5.png" />
			<p>In addition, we developed a dedicated VPN (virtual private network) system to enhance 
				the network security and performance. The VPN works in peer-to-peer (P2P) sytle and 
				in most cases it can establish direct UDP connections across public Internet for 
				devices behind NAT (network address translator), which is a guarantee for high 
				throughput and low latency. My work involves TUN/TAP virtual network interfaces, NAT 
				traversal with STUN/TURN/ICE and UDP hole punching. </p>

			<h3>Live and On-Demand Peer-to-Peer Video Streaming</h3>
			<p>Typical media streaming systems deliver content to clients directly from media server, 
				constantly. Bandwidth cost had limited applications deployment and system expansion 
				(Fig.6). I had led a team to develop a peer-to-peer (P2P) media streaming system that 
				supports low-cost streaming media. All clients in the system work as equal peer nodes 
				simultaneously functioning as “clients” and “servers” to the other nodes. Media content 
				is sliced into pieces by source server, and then content pieces are delivered from 
				server to nodes or from nodes to nodes as requested, rather than constantly (Fig.7). </p>
			<img src="./images/fig-6-7.png" />
			<p>A node has a playing position and caches a range of content around its current position. 
				Distance of two nodes is the difference of their playing positions. Each node keeps a 
				list of peers (other known nodes) that sorted on the distance. A node distributes its 
				cache information periodically to neighbors (some nearest peers), and forwards received 
				cache information to neighbors too (Fig.3). Nodes always try to download content pieces 
				firstly from partners (selected neighbors), and only turn to server when a slice cannot 
				be delivered in time from partners. Nodes schedule downloading from partners or from 
				server based on the maps of content availability updated by partners. In addition, nodes 
				also report their cache information periodically to a tracker sever, so that the tracker 
				server keeps a complete list of nodes and their cache information. When a node just joins 
				the system or in any emergent situations, it may fetch an initial list of peers from the 
				tracker server (Fig.8).</p>
			<img src="./images/fig-8.png" />
			<p>We had also developed a web-based application to provide live and on-demand video streaming 
				service, which supports both traditional media streaming system and our P2P media streaming 
				system as backbone. The application consists of web portal, users management, and 
				advertisement management. I worked as a director to contribute to product requirements, 
				system design, and daily management of software development (Fig.8).</p>

			<h3>Digital and Network-Based Video Surveillance</h3>
			<p>I spent the first 5 years of my career as a software developer in the area of video 
				surveillance, during its latest technology shift from analog CCTV (closed-circuit television) 
				surveillance to full digital, network-based video surveillance systems. I started from very 
				basic work: C++ coding, debugging, and software versioning, in which, however, I got access 
				to the entire source code and documents of a well-designed modern video surveillance system 
				and I could thereby explore and understand every details of the software in a short term. 
				Basically, the system is centered on a digital video recorder (DVR), with remote access over 
				Internet (Fig.9). </p>
			<img src="./images/fig-9.png" />
			<p>The system supports multiple cameras and various peripheral devices for status detection 
				or control. For example, a video matrix switcher is usually used to switch videos to 
				wall-mount monitors or multi-channel DVR. The peripheral devices are connected to DVR 
				through serial communication links. Videos are captured, digitized, and compressed by DVR, 
				and recorded into files on hard drive.  Remote access over Internet is an important 
				extension to local video surveillance. I had developed ActiveX controls and web pages 
				that can work with IE browser to support web style remote surveillance, with which users 
				may connect to DVR over Internet to remotely control peripheral devices, receive real-time 
				streaming videos, or retrieve recorded videos.</p>
			<p>I had also led to develop a plug-in style software framework for video surveillance system 
				to support built-in intelligence, such as sound and motion detection, face detection and 
				recognition, adaptive adjustment of video’s dimension, resolution, and frame rate, and any 
				other user-demand functions. Image analysis and processing algorithms are implemented in a 
				series of software plug-ins (filters), which can be chained working as required. </p>
